      "function": "关系子句简化是指将完整的关系子句（定语从句）通过省略关系代词和系动词，或改变动词形式，转化为更简洁的短语结构。其核心功能是使句子结构更紧凑、表达更流畅，避免重复和冗余。",
      "usage_scenarios": [
        "在正式或非正式的书面语中，使行文更简洁",
        "在口语表达中，使句子更自然流畅",
        "在学术写作或报告中，提升语言的精炼度"

      "description": "关系子句简化的核心规则主要取决于关系子句中动词的语态和时态。",
      "key_points": [
        {
          "point": "主动语态简化",
          "explanation": "当关系子句为主动语态时，通常省略关系代词和be动词，并将主要动词改为现在分词（-ing形式）。例如：The man who is talking to Mary is my teacher. -> The man talking to Mary is my teacher."
        },
        {
          "point": "被动语态简化",
          "explanation": "当关系子句为被动语态时，通常省略关系代词和be动词，保留过去分词。例如：The book which was written by him is popular. -> The book written by him is popular."
        },
        {
          "point": "表示“将来”或“目的”的简化",
          "explanation": "当关系子句表示将来动作或目的时，可以省略关系代词，并将动词改为不定式（to do）。例如：I have some homework that I must do. -> I have some homework to do."
        },
        {
          "point": "简化前提条件",
          "explanation": "简化通常要求关系代词在子句中作主语。如果关系代词作宾语，则通常直接省略，不涉及动词形式变化。例如：The book (that) I bought yesterday is interesting. (that作宾语，直接省略)"

      {
        "sentence": "The girl who is standing over there is my sister.",
        "translation": "站在那边的女孩是我的妹妹。",
        "analysis": "语法解析：原句为主动语态的关系子句（who is standing）。简化时，省略关系代词who和系动词is，将standing保留为现在分词短语，作后置定语。"

      {
        "sentence": "Most of the people invited to the party were old friends.",
        "translation": "被邀请参加派对的人大多是老朋友。",
        "analysis": "语法解析：这是被动语态关系子句的简化。原句可还原为'Most of the people who were invited to the party...'。简化后，省略who were，保留过去分词invited作定语。"
      },
      {
        "sentence": "He is not a man to bow before difficulties.",
        "translation": "他不是一个会在困难面前低头的人。",
        "analysis": "语法解析：这里用不定式to bow简化了关系子句。原意可理解为'He is not a man who will bow before difficulties.'。不定式短语to bow before difficulties表达了'将来'或'倾向性'的定语含义。"
      },
      {
        "sentence": "Anyone following this advice could find themselves in trouble.",
        "translation": "任何听从这一建议的人都可能会发现自己陷入麻烦。",
        "analysis": "语法解析：这是一个进阶例子，简化后的现在分词短语'following this advice'逻辑主语是句子的主语'Anyone'，表示主动和进行的含义，使句子非常紧凑。"
      },
      {
        "sentence": "The boy running in the park is happy. (正确) / The boy is running in the park is happy. (错误)",
        "translation": "在公园里跑步的那个男孩很开心。",
        "analysis": "语法解析：强调常见错误。简化后，'running in the park'是一个修饰'boy'的短语，而不是句子的谓语。错误的句子中出现了两个谓语动词(is running 和 is)，造成了结构错误。切记简化后，原关系子句的动词不再是谓语动词。"

          "explanation": "解析：原句可还原为'The proposal which was discussed at the meeting...'。这是一个被动语态的关系子句，简化时应使用过去分词discussed。B是现在分词，表示主动，不符合'提案被讨论'的被动含义。C包含了关系代词但动词形式错误。D是谓语动词形式，会造成句子有两个谓语。"

          "answer": "B",
          "explanation": "解析：B句中'broken yesterday'是过去分词短语，简化自关系子句'that was broken yesterday'，在句中作后置定语修饰'The window'。A、C、D句中的关系子句都是完整形式，未进行简化。"

          "answer": "A",
          "explanation": "解析：句意是'我们需要一个可以住的地方'。这表示'目的'或'将来'的动作，适合用不定式来简化关系子句（a place where we can stay / in which we can stay）。A 'to stay in'是正确的简化不定式短语，介词in不能省略。B是现在分词，常表示主动或进行，不适合表示目的。C结构错误。D的'for staying'虽然可以表目的，但不如不定式常用和自然。"

          "explanation": "解析：原关系子句'that was invented'是被动语态。简化规则是：省略关系代词(that)和be动词(was)，保留过去分词(invented)。简化后的过去分词短语'invented by...'作后置定语修饰'The machine'。"
