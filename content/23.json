      "function": "名词子句简化是指将包含主语和谓语动词的完整名词子句，通过省略连接词和改变动词形式，转化为更简洁的短语结构（如不定式短语或动名词短语）。其核心功能是使句子表达更精炼、流畅，避免结构臃肿。",

          "explanation": "当名词子句由 that, whether, if 等引导，且主句与子句主语一致或子句主语为泛指时，可省略连接词，并将子句动词转化为非谓语形式。"

          "point": "转化为不定式短语",
          "explanation": "当名词子句表示未来的意图、目的、可能性或必要性时，常简化为“疑问词 + 不定式”或直接“to do”结构。例如：I don't know what I should do. -> I don't know what to do."

          "point": "转化为动名词短语",

          "point": "主语一致性是关键",
          "explanation": "简化通常要求主句的主语和名词子句的（逻辑）主语一致，或者子句主语是泛指的（如 people, one, you）。否则简化可能造成歧义。"

      {
        "sentence": "She suggested that we should leave early.",
        "translation": "她建议我们应该早点离开。",
        "analysis": "语法解析：原句包含 that 引导的名词子句作宾语。由于主句主语“She”和子句主语“we”不一致，通常不能直接简化为“She suggested leaving early.”（那会变成她建议自己离开）。但可以说“She suggested our leaving early.”或保持原句。"

      {
        "sentence": "His goal is that he will become a doctor.",
        "translation": "他的目标是成为一名医生。",
        "analysis": "语法解析：名词子句“that he will become a doctor”作表语，表示未来的意图。由于主句主语“His goal”和子句主语“he”指代同一人，可简化为不定式短语：His goal is to become a doctor."
      },
      {
        "sentence": "I don't remember where I put the keys.",
        "translation": "我不记得我把钥匙放哪儿了。",
        "analysis": "语法解析：名词子句“where I put the keys”作宾语。由于子句主语“I”与主句主语一致，且动作“放”已经发生，可考虑简化为动名词短语“putting the keys”，但“where”需要保留。更常见的简化是使用“疑问词+动名词”或保持原句。更地道的简化是：I don't remember putting the keys anywhere. (但丢失了地点信息)。本例展示了并非所有名词子句都适合简化。"
      },
      {
        "sentence": "The committee's decision, that the project be terminated, was unexpected.",
        "translation": "委员会终止该项目的决定出乎意料。",
        "analysis": "语法解析：这是一个进阶例子，名词子句“that the project be terminated”是同位语，解释“decision”的内容。这种同位语从句可以简化为不定式短语或“of + 动名词”结构，使句子更紧凑：The committee's unexpected decision was to terminate the project. 或 The committee's decision to terminate the project was unexpected."

      {
        "sentence": "I want that you finish the report by Friday. (易错)",
        "translation": "我希望你在周五前完成报告。（错误表达）",
        "analysis": "语法解析：这是一个常见错误。动词“want”后面不能直接接“that”引导的名词子句。正确的表达要么使用不定式简化结构（I want you to finish the report by Friday.），要么换用其他动词如“hope”或“request”（I hope that you can finish...）。这说明了简化有时是语法上的强制要求，而不仅仅是风格选择。"

          "answer": "C",
          "explanation": "解析：C错误。动词“promise”后接动作时，必须接不定式（to do），不能接动名词。正确简化是：She promised to help. B正确，“discuss”后接动名词。A正确，但属于较正式用法。D正确，但“when to arrive”的逻辑主语需是主句主语“He”，与原句一致。"

          "answer": "B",
