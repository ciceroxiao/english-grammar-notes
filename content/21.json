      "function": "简化子句（Reduced Clauses）是一种将状语从句或定语从句进行精简的语法手段，通过省略主语和部分谓语动词（通常是be动词），使句子结构更紧凑、表达更简洁。它常用于书面语和正式文体中，以提升语言的精炼度。",
      "usage_scenarios": [
        "在正式写作中使句子更简洁有力",
        "在描述连续动作或状态时避免重复",
        "在科技、法律或学术文献中精炼表达"

    "rules": {
      "description": "简化子句的核心在于省略从句中与主句重复的主语和be动词，或将动词改为非谓语形式（现在分词、过去分词或不定式）。",

          "point": "省略主语与be动词",
          "explanation": "当状语从句或定语从句的主语与主句主语一致，且从句包含be动词时，可以省略主语和be动词，保留分词、形容词或介词短语。例如：\"While (he was) walking in the park, he saw a bird.\""

        {
          "point": "使用现在分词（-ing）",
          "explanation": "若原从句的动词为主动语态且与主句动作同时发生，可省略主语和be动词，将主要动词改为现在分词。例如：\"Because she studies hard, she gets good grades.\" 可简化为 \"Studying hard, she gets good grades.\""

          "point": "使用过去分词（-ed）",
          "explanation": "若原从句的动词为被动语态，可省略主语和be动词，保留过去分词。例如：\"The book that was written by him is popular.\" 可简化为 \"The book written by him is popular.\""

          "point": "注意逻辑主语一致",
          "explanation": "简化子句的前提是省略的主语必须与主句主语逻辑上一致，否则会造成悬垂修饰错误。例如：\"Walking in the park, the flowers looked beautiful.\"（错误，因为\"花\"不能\"走\"）。"

          "answer": "B",
          "explanation": "解析：B选项简化子句\"Running quickly\"的逻辑主语应该是执行\"跑\"这个动作的人，但主句主语是\"the bus\"（公交车），公交车自己不会跑，因此逻辑主语不一致，是典型的悬垂分词错误。A、C是被动意义的过去分词，D是现在分词，其逻辑主语均与主句主语一致。"
